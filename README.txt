Welcome!
This is the guildline which will tell you how to use LAN Music Controller

There will be 2 folder:
+ Server Folder will put on the computer which has Music Folder
+ Client Folder will put on devices on which you want to control

Server Folder will have these file: "Playmusic.py", "Server.py", "Server Configuration.py"
Client Folder will have these file: "Client.py", "Client Configuration.py"

- First of all, run "Server Configuration.py" or "Client Configuration.py" to setup things needed.
- Next, you need to run "Server.py" first and let it RUN at BACKGROUND
- Then, run Client on any devices you want
- Finally, enjoy it!
